# Landing page project

Instructions
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

# first #
We create the list and push items to it, and this happened from lines 78 to 88
Where we have defined all the sections from the index.html file in the form of an array and we have created four elements containing the four sections and pushed them into our list

# secondly #
We enabled the feature to click on any of the four sections and move directly to it relatively slowly using events, and that was done from lines 95 to 133

# Third #
We also activate the feature to change the background color of the section while moving and passing through it or standing at it from line 22 to 31
